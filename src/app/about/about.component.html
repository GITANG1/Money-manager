    The idea behind Money-App is that we need the right tool to manage our personal finances. Some people use Excel, some use a paper and pen, and some use personal accounting software-- but most of us just don’t know what to do. Our financial lives are complicated-- cash, cards, savings, debt-- and we’re not all born gifted accountants.

    Managing money is a highly important and highly personal issue for us at Money-App. We’re a small team; some of us are single, some are married, and some of us have kids-- but regardless of our situation, but we all face these issues. We’re real people with real problems.
    
    So we embarked on a mission to solve our problem and hopefully solve yours. And thus Money-App was born-- a simple, seamless, and intuitive tool to manage your personal finances. We want to give you a 360 view on your money; what comes in, what goes out, what you have saved, what you have budgeted. We want to give you the tools to understand where your money goes, and empower you to set and achieve financial goals.
    
    We’re pretty proud of what we’ve done so far. Every day thousands of people from around the world download and experience Money-App for their first time. The response from our users has been overwhelming and humbling. But, we still have a long way to go.
    
    We hope you enjoy Wally.
